# Embedded Finance

“BaaS is known as embedded finance when it is inserted into customer journeys as financial products. Providers may be banks, or they may be fintech companies acting as distributors with banks on the backend. The term embedded finance reflects the evolution of open banking into open finance, which represents more than just open banking with a broader scope.”

“Embedded finance is the concept of taking BaaS solutions and embedding them into a non-financial business’ mobile application or website. With embedded finance, any business could have a financial component incorporated into its business.

For example, a department store would like to issue a branded credit card for their store with different features, rewards, and perks. The department store can partner with a bank to issue the card and obtain end users without becoming a financial institution themselves. The department store would still be heavily involved in compliance and regulatory obligations, but the banking piece is managed by the bank.

The concept of embedded finance can create a personalized financial experience for dedicated end-user bases of existing businesses that adds value to the customer.”

“How do companies make money from embedded finance powered by BaaS?

Embedded financial products can be a great way to drive acquisition, engagement, and retention. But what’s most appealing for many companies is the revenue it generates.

There are five ways to make money from embedded banking. If you’re looking for a way to project what that might look like for your company, check out our revenue calculator and full revenue projection tool.

  - Interchange fees. These are fees you earn when your customers make purchases with their debit, credit, and charge cards. These card payments typically return between 1.5–3% of every transaction as interchange revenue. Companies typically keep the revenue, return it to their customers in the form of rewards, or some combination thereof. Learn more in our interchange revenue guide.

  - Financing revenues. Embedded finance comes in many forms; some of the most common are credit and charge cards, term loans, and revolving lines of credit, cash advances, and invoice factoring. We expect that lending will emerge as a primary source of revenue for tech companies in coming years. To learn more about how you can make money from offering lending products, check out our lending guide.

  - Deposit fees. In some cases, companies may be eligible to earn fees on the deposits they generate for their bank partner through their marketing efforts. 

  - Platform fees. These are often overlooked as a source of revenue associated with embedding banking and lending products. Some companies may choose to offer access to their embedded banking products at an extra cost. For example, you may be able to charge a monthly fee for customers who opt into your embedded financial products. Alternatively, you could adopt a “freemium” model, giving customers access to basic financial products for free, then charging a monthly fee for access to more advanced features.
  
  - Payment fees. Using banking as a service, you build many different payment methods into your product; these include ACH, cards, wires, and book transfers. Your customers will expect some kinds of payments (e.g., ACH, transfers between accounts at the same bank) to be free, but it’s possible to charge for others (e.g., wire transfers, push-to-card).”
