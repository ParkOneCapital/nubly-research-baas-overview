# Open Banking vs. Banking-as-a-Service

“So, Banking as a Service is the same as open banking?

No, not really. The two models often get confused, as open banking also involves banks connecting to non-banks via API. However, the models serve entirely different purposes. In BaaS models, non-bank businesses integrate complete banking services into their own products. In open banking models on the other hand, non-bank businesses merely use the bank’s data for their products. In the industry, these non-bank businesses are called third party service providers (TPPs).“

“Sometimes confused, Open Banking and Banking as a Service refers to two different models.

Having become mandatory in January 2018, Open Banking consists of opening banks' information systems. Customer data can thus be shared with third parties and financial service providers.

This model promotes collaboration between banks and new partners. This is how the fintech in our example can connect to the bank's feeds to offer banking services to its customers.

In short, Open Banking has paved the way for BaaS: the bank now can offer third parties the possibility of integrating banking products on their platform or application.”
