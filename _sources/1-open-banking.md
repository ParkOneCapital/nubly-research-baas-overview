### Open banking and the era of the API

To understand open banking and banking-as-a-service we must understand what APIs are as they serve as the technological backbone enabling secure, standardized, and regulated data exchange between financial institutions, third-party providers, and customers.

“An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs.

In a more simple way — API is a set of ways and rules for interaction and data exchange between different programs and computers. The API is used for other programs and information systems where information is exchanged in a strictly specified format, which allows systems with completely incompatible configurations to interact (written in different programming languages, located locally or remotely, etc.). An Application Programming Interface is like a messenger between different systems.”

In the context of a bank an API enables secure and standardized communication between the bank's systems and external third-party providers, allowing them to access customer account information and initiate actions, such as payments or transfers, with the customer's consent. This enables banks to offer a wider range of services, increase innovation, and improve customer experience, while maintaining control over their systems and data. By providing a standardized interface, banks can integrate with multiple third-party providers, fostering an ecosystem of financial services that can be easily accessed and utilized by customers.

“Open banking uses technology like APIs to offer nonfinancial and financial businesses a network of financial products like accounts and transaction methods. This means third-party providers are allowed access to payment products so they can design and build new user experiences. From the bank perspective, Open Banking is like extending their banking charter to other companies.
An example of open banking would be a personal finance app enabled by banking technology that lets customers view insights into their monthly spending online.”

“Open banking is the ability to securely share your financial accounts’ data to access innovative financial experiences. Traditionally, only you and your bank could access your financial data. Open banking allows you to share that data with another financial service provider — either a different financial institution or third party, and empowers you to use your own data for your own benefit. Third-party providers can include a wide range of fintechs, currency exchanges, merchants and other digital platforms.”

“Open Banking is a process of financial institutions exchanging information with third-party providers (TPPs) with the account holders’ explicit consent. The TPPs most often are fintech or fintech-related start-ups like mobile banking apps. The information is exchanged through API’s with the help of data aggregators like Plaid.”
