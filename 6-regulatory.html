<h2>“What are open banking regulations?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-open-banking-regulations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Open banking regulations are rules and guidelines that regulatory bodies establish to govern how banks and third-party providers share financial data. The purpose of these regulations is to increase market competition, promote innovation, and improve consumer choice in the financial services industry while ensuring consumer data remains private and secure. Here are the key elements of open banking regulations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Consumer consent: The principle that consumers own their financial data governs open banking regulation. Regulations require that banks can share customer data with TPPs only after obtaining explicit consent.</p></li>
<li><p>API standardization: Open banking regulations often require the standardization of APIs, which makes it easier and safer to share and access data across different systems and platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Access rights and responsibilities: Regulations define the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in open banking, including the conditions under which TPPs are allowed to access bank data, what they can do with the data, and the data security and integrity standards they must meet.</p></li>
<li><p>Security protocols: Open banking regulations require rigorous security requirements to prevent data breaches and fraud. This includes the use of strong encryption, authentication methods, and regular security audits.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory oversight: Open banking regulations often require businesses to practice regular reporting, adhere to operational standards, and participate in security audits.”</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="who-regulates-open-banking">
<h3>“Who regulates open banking?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-regulates-open-banking" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>United States: Currently, there is no comprehensive federal regulation for open banking in the US. In October 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule to implement Section 1033 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, which would give consumers the right to access and share their financial data. This rule, if finalized, will establish a federal framework for open banking, and the CFPB will oversee its implementation. Meanwhile, several states have introduced or are considering their own open banking legislation, and industry-led organizations such as the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) have established voluntary data-sharing standards.”</p>

<section id="what-are-open-banking-standards">
<h3>What are open banking standards?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-open-banking-standards" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>“Open banking standards are a set of technical specifications and guidelines that enable safe and effective data sharing between banks and authorized TPPs. These standards ensure interoperability, security, and consumer protection in the open banking process.
Key components of open banking standards</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>APIs: APIs provide a standardized way for different software systems to communicate with each other. In open banking, open data API specifications allow TPPs to access customer financial data from banks.</p></li>
<li><p>Data formats: Open banking standards define the structure and format of the data that banks and TPPs exchange, so different applications can easily interpret and use the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Security protocols: Open banking standards require strong security measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect consumer data from unauthorized access and misuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer authentication: Open banking standards also specify the methods for customer authentication so that only authorized individuals can access and share their financial data.</p></li>
<li><p>Error handling and reporting: Open banking standards provide mechanisms for error handling and reporting issues that might arise during data exchange.”</p></li>

<h1>“Regulators ramp up pressure on BaaS banks”<a class="headerlink" href="#regulators-ramp-up-pressure-on-baas-banks" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>“Banks that operate banking-as-a-service programs are facing heightened scrutiny from bank regulators, as examiners scramble to get a handle on the size and scale of lenders’ partnerships with fintechs, said Konrad Alt, a partner at financial services advisory and investment firm Klaros Group.”</p>
<p>This increased pressure follows this spring’s banking crisis, which saw the collapse of three regional lenders that were all closely bound to the fintech sector.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/regulators-pressure-baas-banks-fintech-partner-occ-fdic-konrad-alt/696325/"><img alt="OCC" src="_images/occ.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank both catered heavily to the VC and startup space, while Signature Bank was known as a crypto-friendly firm. Those lenders’ close ties to technology haven’t escaped the attention of regulators, Alt says.</p>
<p>“For banks that are in the BaaS space today that haven’t gone through an exam in a while, they are going to be in a shell shock for what’s coming there,” Amesbury, Massachusetts-based BankProv Executive Vice President and COO Joseph Mancini told S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence in May.</p>
<p>Mancini said his bank has noticed increased scrutiny from regulators looking into whether the firm is taking ownership of actively managing its fintech tie-ups.</p>
<p>Alt said the heightened scrutiny comes as regulators attempt to recalibrate their supervision of banks that operate BaaS programs.</p>
<p>Banks that partner with fintechs tend to have smaller balance sheets, meaning they don’t necessarily fall under regulators’ lists of firms that deserve heightened scrutiny, Alt said.</p>
<section id="middleware-under-the-microscope">
<h2>Middleware under the microscope<a class="headerlink" href="#middleware-under-the-microscope" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While operating a BaaS program allows banks to grow their assets, often on a national scale, the arrangement creates a layer between traditional banks and deposit holders, as fintechs like neobanks take on the front-facing aspect of the client relationship.</p>
<p>In some cases, an additional platform sits in between the bank and fintech, providing the middleware that helps connect the two parties. These partnerships are also coming under increased scrutiny from regulators, as the dynamic creates an additional layer of risk, Alt said.</p>
<p>“It puts a distance between the banks and the fintechs and complicates questions about knowing who you’re dealing with,” Alt said. “I think [middleware providers] are probably even less well understood by the regulators than the fintech sector generally, because they’re not consumer facing in any way.”</p>
<p>While third-party BaaS providers can help bridge the connectivity gap between fintechs and their banking partners, a fintech will often opt for a direct partnership with its BaaS bank once it reaches a certain level of maturity, Alt said.</p>
<p>More robust, larger and mature fintechs are generally going to think they’re better off minimizing the number of players in their banking relationship,” said Alt, speaking broadly about the relationship between fintechs and their middleware providers. “It’s better to have direct dialogue with your bank than to have that intermediated by some platform, even if the platform’s pretty good.””</p>

<h1>“Lawmakers push for crackdown on fintech, ban on false claims”<a class="headerlink" href="#lawmakers-push-for-crackdown-on-fintech-ban-on-false-claims" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>“Two Democratic senators have urged regulators to ban the use of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. name or logo by firms that provide products only eligible for pass-through FDIC insurance and establish clear rules for banking-as-a-service companies.</p>
<p>In a letter sent Wednesday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and Chris Van Hollen, D-MD, highlighted that the partnerships between banks, BaaS providers like Stripe, Finastra, Synapse, and Marqueta and fintechs like Venmo, Cash App, Yotta, and Chime pose a threat to consumer safety and soundness.</p>
<p>They asked the heads of the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC to exercise their power under the Bank Service Company Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to directly monitor the organizations and bring enforcement action against the companies if they violate the established rules.</p>
<p>“The rapid growth of these partnerships risks harming consumers while posing a broader threat to the stability of our banking system and the economy,” the senators wrote. “The risks are clear.”</p>
<p>Revenue from BaaS is expected to reach $17.3 billion in 2026, according to the letter.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lawmakers-warren-van-hollen-push-crackdown-fintech-ban-false-claims/727005/"><img alt="Elizabeth Warren" src="_images/elizabeth_warren.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Warren and Van Hollen pressed the heads of the federal agencies to prohibit the use of misrepresentations related to FDIC insurance. Companies like Yotta, they wrote, put more emphasis on “FDIC-insured” in large text on their websites while explaining what the term means – that the money is held in an account eligible for pass-through FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 through the partner bank – in smaller text.</p>
<p>They clarified that pass-through deposit insurance refers to a process by which deposit accounts are established by a third party for the benefit of one or more other principal parties.</p>
<p>In March, the FDIC demanded three companies and certain associated parties cease making false and misleading statements about FDIC deposit insurance. The senators commended the FDIC’s enforcement actions against banks like Evolve Bank &amp; Trust and Blue Ridge Bank, pushing those lenders to better monitor their third-party relationships.</p>
<p>“The growing integration of the services offered by apps such as Venmo, CashApp, and PayPal into bank infrastructure through BaaS intermediaries such as Synapse requires additional oversight by your agencies — and the establishment of clear rules instead of the ad-hoc enforcement approach that you have used to date,” the lawmakers asserted.</p>
<p>They also applauded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for recognizing the growing importance of nonbank financial technology companies, some of which now handle over 5 million transactions annually.  The lawmakers applauded the CFPB’s expanded oversight under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and backed its proposal for stricter enforcement of consumer protection laws across the fintech industry.”</p>

<h1>“Banks mindful of outsourcing duties in fintech partnerships”<a class="headerlink" href="#banks-mindful-of-outsourcing-duties-in-fintech-partnerships" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>“Banks are increasingly underscoring the importance of working directly with their financial technology partners, rather than relying heavily on outside program managers when implementing banking-as-a-service.</p>
<p>The rise of banking-as-a-service (BaaS) has produced a group of fintech vendors, such as Treasury Prime Inc., Unit Finance Inc. and Synapse Financial Technologies Inc., to help banks and fintechs set up partnerships. They typically act as the middleware, assisting both sides on technology implementation and program management.</p>
<p>Regulators appear to be examining banks’ reliance on those middleware vendors when providing BaaS and expect them to actively engage in their fintech partnerships as opposed to letting the middleware vendors take over critical duties, especially compliance.</p>
<p>Supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Amesbury, Mass.-based BankProv has noticed increased scrutiny, gauging whether it is taking ownership of actively managing those partnerships in its most recent exam, said Joseph Mancini, executive vice president and COO at BankProv.</p>
<p>Some of the recommendations that came out from our recent exam were very specific to what’s coming down the line in BaaS,” Mancini said in an interview. “They want the bank to manage, versus [using] the middleware model.”</p>
<p>The FDIC’s emphasis on banks being the main managers could have broader implications, prompting some banks to adjust their pricing models with fintech partners, or change the allocation of resources in the back office, Mancini said. For instance, banks would ideally have the in-house resources to monitor the activities of fintech partners and conduct know-your-customer procedures on every client, he noted.</p>
<p>BankProv, which works with Treasury Prime to manage fintech partnerships, did not get the impression that regulators discourage banks to work with middleware vendors, Mancini said. No matter what tools banks want to use, the goal is to work diligently to keep third-party risks under control.</p>
<p>Rogersville, Tenn.-based Thread Bank is following the approach of engaging with its fintech partners directly even though it works with Unit Finance to help manage those programs, said John Bearden, chief banking officer at Thread Bank.</p>
<p>“When we got started with them, our approach from day one was we’re going out in the relationship with the fintech,” Bearden said in an interview.</p>
<p>Thread Bank supports fintechs to offer depository and payments services to their end customers, primarily small businesses. The bank started focusing on the BaaS model after a group of investors recapitalized the Tennessee-chartered bank in May 2021.</p>
<p>Still, Unit’s technology is valuable to Thread Bank since it enhances the bank’s capabilities in areas like account ledgering, Bearden said. Unit also provides Thread Bank access to compliance tools to either use them on its own or find third-party service providers.</p>
<p>With Unit’s “frontline diligence,” Thread Bank is in fact doubling up on some of the compliance work to ensure sufficient transaction and fraud monitoring, Bearden said.</p>
<p>“For us, it’s kind of a tri-party relationship between the fintech, bank and unit. It’s a little bit different than some of the other BaaS relationships that I’ve seen in the marketplace,” Bearden said.”</p>

<h1>“BaaS is Not in Crisis: BaaS Banks Less Likely to Be Fined Than Non-BaaS Banks”<a class="headerlink" href="#baas-is-not-in-crisis-baas-banks-less-likely-to-be-fined-than-non-baas-banks" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>“A wave of overwhelmingly negative coverage of Banking as a Service (BaaS) has focused on enforcement actions and consent orders against sponsor banks, painting a bleak picture of the future of embedded finance in the United States.</p>
<p>However, a data-driven review of enforcement actions issued between January 2023 and July 2024 by the three main federal banking regulators — the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve (FRB), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) — shows continued regulatory support for BaaS and financial innovation.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.castellum.ai/insights/analysis-baas-enforcement-actions-2024"><img alt="Enforcement Action Fines 2023 - Present" src="_images/enforcement_action_fines.png" /></a></p>
<p>In total, fines against non-sponsor banks were 10 times larger than those targeting BaaS sponsor banks. Moreover, 42% of BaaS-related civil monetary penalties relate to one fine targeting a bank offering crypto services: Silvergate. Silvergate’s collapse and associated consent order and fine is best viewed in the context of the FTX collapse and regulatory scrutiny on decentralized finance, not the broader BaaS ecosystem.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.castellum.ai/insights/analysis-baas-enforcement-actions-2024"><img alt="Number of Enforcement Actions with Fines since 2023" src="_images/number_of_enforcement.png" /></a></p>
<p>Fines against non-sponsor banks are also more frequent. 18% of enforcement actions against non-sponsor banks included civil monetary penalties (CMPs), while only 13% of enforcement actions against banks involved in BaaS activities included fines.</p>
<p>The lower value and frequency of CMPs targeting banks in the BaaS space reinforces the view that regulators emphasize remediation and corrective action to improve compliance, not simply penalize the industry.</p>
<p>Since January 2024, 18.3% of enforcement actions have targeted BaaS banks. This represents an increase over 2023 when S&amp;P Global noted that 13.5% of enforcement actions targeted BaaS. However, the rise has been modest, given the industry’s rapid growth and the increased regulatory focus.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.castellum.ai/insights/analysis-baas-enforcement-actions-2024"><img alt="2024 Enforcement Actions Against Banks" src="_images/enforcement_banks.png" /></a></p>
<p>Regulators have consistently highlighted Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) deficiencies in BaaS banks. 64% of all enforcement actions against BaaS sponsor banks have focused on AML shortfalls, compared to 29% for non-BaaS banks.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.castellum.ai/insights/analysis-baas-enforcement-actions-2024"><img alt="Percent of Enforcement Actions Focused on AML Deficiencies" src="_images/percent_enforcement_aml_deficiencies.png" /></a></p>
<p>This high proportion of AML-related actions underscores the challenges banks face when expanding to new markets, customers, and products through fintech partnerships, often without scaling their compliance programs to compensate for new risk exposure.</p>
<p>Regulators have routinely identified the following AML deficiencies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>KYC Procedures and Technology: Insufficient due diligence processes, including onboarding screening, inadequate customer identification programs (CIP), failure to identify beneficial owners, and ineffective monitoring of high-risk accounts. This is especially prevalent among sponsor banks that lack effective customer information sharing with fintech partners.</p></li>
<li><p>Transaction Monitoring and SAR Filings: Inadequate monitoring systems that fail to detect suspicious activities. Enforcement actions also highlight untimely or incomplete Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) filings.</p></li>
<li><p>Governance and Oversight: Inadequate authority granted to BSA officers and weak board and management oversight of third-party risk and compliance programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Staffing and Training: Inadequate staff training on BSA/AML compliance and insufficient updates to compliance-related programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Risk Assessments: Failure to conduct comprehensive and timely BSA/AML risk assessments, and failure to adjust them based on evolving risks associated with customers, products, geographies, or transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Independent Testing: Deficiencies in independent audits and BSA/AML program reviews, including insufficient scope, lack of depth in testing, and failure to address audit findings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no doubt that sponsor banks are under regulatory scrutiny, but the above makes clear that regulators are balancing their primary objective of ensuring consumer safety with enabling financial innovation.</p>
<p>Regulators have put an emphasis on evaluating the efficacy of compliance programs at sponsor banks that have quickly scaled up their fintech partnership programs. The absence of widespread fines and instead a focus on remediation reinforces that the objective is to address compliance deficiencies, not discourage innovation.</p>
<p>To that end, regulators are shifting their approach and addressing BaaS and fintechs directly. Whereas regulatory guidance has often addressed broad “third-party risk management” in its advisories or enforcement actions, recent actions have have started to make specific reference to fintechs (such as the FDIC’s May 2024 Consent Order with Thread Bank).</p>
<p>To mitigate the risk of consent orders, sponsor banks should adopt best practices that align with regulatory expectations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Strengthen AML Technology and Procedures: Invest in compliance technology that can handle new risks associated with onboarding new customers and offering new products through fintech partners. Ensure that policies are updated and strong information sharing processes enable effective KYC and transaction screening associated with services offered by your fintech partners.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance Transaction Monitoring: Invest in advanced systems that can identify suspicious transactions in real-time and ensure timely, complete Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) filings.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve Governance and Oversight: Grant greater authority to BSA/AML officers and ensure strong board-level oversight of compliance programs and require fintech partners to similarly invest in their AML compliance programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct Regular Independent Testing: Implement comprehensive audits and BSA/AML program reviews to address any gaps before regulatory scrutiny.</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust Risk Assessments: Regularly update risk assessments and ensure that risk assessments include adequate scope and dept to account for changes in customer profiles, products, and market conditions.”</p></li>
